VolumeManager
=============

Introduction
------------
VolumeManager is a tool for GNUstep that listens for hald events concerning
storage volumes. VolumeManager is then able to automount data devices or to
autoplay CDs and DVDs using appropriate services.
VolumeManager can also notify other GNUstep applications via DO if the state
of any volume changes, e.g. if it is mounted or unmounted.
VolumeManager runs as a daemon in the background and has only few GUI elements.

VolumeManager is GPL'ed. Read the COPYING file.
All bugs reports should be sent to Andreas Schik <andreas@schik.de>.


GNUstep system
--------------
o VolumeManager has been tested on GNU/Linux using the following versions
  of GNUstep:

gnustep-base	1.21
gnustep-gui	0.19

o Note, that VolumeManager will probably not run on older versions of GNUstep.

o VolumeManager needs DBusKit to compile and run.

o VolumeManager needs TrayIconKit (https://github.com/schik/trayiconkit) to
  compile and run.

o VolumeManager needs the pmount tools for automounting support. If those tools
  are not installed the respective functions will report an error on the command
  line during run time.


How to build VolumeManager
----------------------------
o To build VolumeManager simply do the following:
  make

o To install VolumeManager simply do the following:
  make install


Subprojects
---------------
There exists one subproject: Preferences. It is not built or installed by default.
You need to descend into the respective subdirectory and do this manually if
desired.
Preferences is a plugin to SystemPreferences. It provides a GUI to setup the user
defaults for VolumeManager.
Simply do a
    make install

in the Preferences subdirectory to install it.


The GUI
-------
Even though running as daemon in the background, VolumeManager has a few GUI
elements. After a data volume has been mounted, an icon will appear in the system
tray. Clicking on the icon will bring up a window providing a list of mounted
volumes. This window also provides the possibility to unmount a volume via mouse
click. As soon as all volumes are unmounted, the icon hides.
If no system tray application is running on the system, no icon will appear and
you will not be able to access the list of mounted volumes. In that case, you
must unmount volumes manually.

If a new volume is mounted, VolumeManager will notify you. It first tries to
reach the Notification service registered on the d-bus. If no such service exists
VolumeManager will display a notification using the system tray. If this does not
exist either, no notification is shown at all.


Preferences
-----------
Using the preferences panel you may set the following:
- Switch on and off automounting of data volumes.
- Define GNUstep services to use for automatically opening mounted file systems
  and for automatically playing CDs and DVDs.
- Switch on and off notifications.


Using the services to autoopen or autoplay CDs/DVDs
---------------------------------------------------
It is possible to use GWorkspace to automatically open a mounted file system.
Simply use the 'Open in GWorkspace' service to do this. After mounting the
volume, VolumeManager will then automtically open the mount point in a GWorkspace
browser window.

CDPlayer 0.5 provides a service for autoplaying audio CDs. Simply use the service
name "CDPlayer/Play CD". As an alternative you may use Terminal.app to start up
any other CD playing software. Here is an example for how to create a Termial
service to start goobox:

    "Play CD" = {
        AcceptTypes = 1;
        Commandline = "goobox -d \"%s\" --play &";
        Input = 2;
        Key = "";
        ReturnData = 0;
        Type = 0;
    };

To play DVDs, GNUstep does not offer (yet) an appropriate application.
You may however use Terminal.app to create a service that opens an external
application, e.g. mplayer:

    "Play DVD" = {
        AcceptTypes = 1;
        Commandline = "mplayer dvd://1-99 \"%s\"";
        Input = 2;
        Key = "";
        ReturnData = 0;
        Type = 1;
    };
